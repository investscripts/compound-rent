# compound-rent
Calculates rate of growth from rent profits and personal contributions. Each 50K bump in growth your rental cashflow increases by $1000 USD.
This amount will be configurable on the command line in the future. 

The idea is that, for every 50K increase, you put that money down on a rental property that provides $1000 USD in cashflow. 

1. Enter your intial nestegg amount you're starting with. It's ok to start without anything. 

2. Provide the script the number of months to calculate your contributions and rental income. 

3. Provide any personal contributions from your W2 income, or side hustle to accelerate growth.

4. Provide cashflow from existing rental properties to accelerate growth.
